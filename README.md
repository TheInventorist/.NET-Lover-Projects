# Projects

## Unity

### 3Dversity
- This software, more like an MVP, was developed for an assingment of my univeristy (Universidad Andres Bello, Software Engineering 1), feel free to use it with proper credits. the software uses Leap Motion for controlling hands in a virtual environment, this with the objective of rotating and looking different faces of a geometric figure or a crystal (meant for students of geology).

### Hero Born
- Hero born is a shooting minigame where the player must collect 4 object on the map without getting touch by the enemy A.I. The only weapon of the hero is shooting balls against its enemies. This book taught me how to create a project in unity using it's best practices, with events, delegates, OOP programming, etc. Recomended for beginners and experimented users who wants to improve their foundations of this engine.

### RumRum!
- Junior Programming is a great approach for starters to get the main concepts of unity. I went the entire pathway learning new concepts and remembering others. I liked a lot the practical part because it was full of challanges and bonus, this game is just a car moving with [WASD] and trying to avoid obstacles on the road.
